<p>When you're writing embedded systems, you have two main options for languages, C and Assembly. You probably want to stick with C since assembly is really annoying and a huge pain. Because of that, the first thing you want to do is just get a handle on C. Most basic tutorials should be sufficient for this. Learn basic syntax and data types. Make sure to also learn how to use pointers and the difference between the stack and the heap.</p>
